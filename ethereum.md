# Ethereum Basics

- ethereum is a protocol
- opensource blockchain based platform

### node 
- type of node : full node, light node, archive node
- full node is done varification of all transaction and data, full node have all copy of blockchain
- light node have header of block and when they need a data so they call full node and get data.
- archive node have big storage, start form first node/block till date, this node have history of blockchain, requried terabytes of storage

### Accounts in Ethereum
- type of ethereum account : 1) externally owned account 2) Contract account
- 1) externally owned account : when we create a wallet this will created, 
- 2) contract account : when we deploy a smart contract this will created, controlled by contract

### smart contract
- is a pice of code which is immutable
- run on blockchain of ethereum
- write in solidity
- and this language is turing complete means we implement what we want.

### EVM
- this is env which run on local system use and run on blockchain

### gas
- fee for run smart contract on blockchain
- all operations have their own gas fee

### gas price
- high gas fee out transaction will done fast

### GAS limit
- max program is consumed gas

### Ethereum block
- nonce, hash, merkle root, timestamp, previous hash, transaction field are present in block

### DOA
- organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program, typically running on a blockchain. DAOs are transparent, decentralized, and operate without a central governing body.
- attackers can manipulate DAOs by manipulating the rules.

### hard fork
- devide in two chain

### soft fork
- app update

### ICO

### prof of stack
- we put ether on system after that we be validator after that we mine ether

### sharding
- group of validator work on spacifinc blockchain chunk

### alt coin
- ex. dogecoin, litecoin, monero, ripple, zcash
