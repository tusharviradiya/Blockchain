# where data store in blockchain technology
- there is no any datastation, data store in computer which is connected with blockchain
- each node is a hold ledger copy for immutable feature
- this need hardware to store data and for that reason miner need high power system and when block count are more so we need more space and when we need more space we add node
- but node size is not like google datastaion, because blockchain is save transaction data not actual data
