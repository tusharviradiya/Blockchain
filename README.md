# Blockchain

## What is a centralized network?

A **centralized network** is a type of communication system where all data and devices connect and communicate through a **single, central server or authority.**

### disadvantages

1. single point of failure.

## What is a decentralized network?

decentralized network distributes data and control across multiple, **independent nodes or devices**. There's no single point of failure or authority dictating how the network operates.

- blockchin use decentralized network.

## What the hell is blockchain ?

#### **what is ledger?**

- blockchain use this ledger for save the transaction.
- ledger is can be in any form text, json, word file
- ledger is store in block, and block contain other thing then ledger.
- **complete block** : when block fill full, and when block is completed so next new block is generated.
- all block contains same data copy of every block, and due to this feature we don't cheat data of blockchain.

### working of blockchain

- blockchain use ledger for save transaction data.
- block is known as node also.
- when transaction is done so here public is available, not user name, therefore user privacy is maintained.
- ex. when one person do transaction so validation request spread all node for validation that person have money or not.
- in this example we not need to approval of all person, after that this transaction is add with other transaction and create one block and this block is add in blockchain.

### component of blockchain :

- when blockchain works so they use some component so this called component of blockchain.

1. **node :** user of blockchain

   - **full node** : this node have all copy of blockchain, and this full node is do broadcasting(means send message to other node excepts own node), initializing and validation/verify.
   - **partial node** : this node have note enough memory but this node wants to be a part of blockchain, basically this node contains only header of transaction. and no rights to initializing, broadcasting and validation of transaction.
