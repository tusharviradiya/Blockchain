# Blockchain

## What is a centralized network?

A **centralized network** is a type of communication system where all data and devices connect and communicate through a **single, central server or authority.**

### disadvantages

1. single point of failure.

## What is a decentralized network?

decentralized network distributes data and control across multiple, **independent nodes or devices**. There's no single point of failure or authority dictating how the network operates.

- blockchin use decentralized network.

## What the hell is blockchain ?

#### types of bockchain :

1. public blockchain : ex. bitcoin, ethereum.
1. private blockchain : this called centralized network, ex. hyper laser fabric, corda.
1. consortium blockchain : chosen node only validate transaction.

#### **what is ledger?**

- blockchain use this ledger for save the transaction.
- ledger is can be in any form text, json, word file
- ledger is store in block, and block contain other thing then ledger.
- **complete block** : when block fill full, and when block is completed so next new block is generated.
- all block contains same data copy of every block, and due to this feature we don't cheat data of blockchain.

### working of blockchain

- blockchain use ledger for save transaction data.
- block is known as node also.
- when transaction is done so here public is available, not user name, therefore user privacy is maintained.
- ex. when one person do transaction so validation request spread all node for validation that person have money or not.
- in this example we not need to approval of all person, after that this transaction is add with other transaction and create one block and this block is add in blockchain.

### component of blockchain :

- when blockchain works so they use some component so this called component of blockchain.

1. **node :** user of blockchain

   - **full node** : this node have all copy of blockchain, and this full node is do broadcasting(means send message to other node excepts own node), initializing and validation/verify.

     - **minor** is type of full node

   - **partial node** : this node have note enough memory but this node wants to be a part of blockchain, basically this node contains only header of transaction. and no rights to initializing, broadcasting and validation of transaction.

   - **ladger** : contains transaction history.

   1. property of ledger :
      - distributed ledger
      - node have same ledger copy
      - immutability of data

   - **wallet** :

     - wallet have public key and private key.
     - when we need to do transaction so we share our node's public key not private key.
     - **type of wallet** :

     1. hot wallet : this wallet is online wallet, use for day to day transaction, connected to internet(problem from hackers)
     1. cold wallet : not connected to internet, user need to purchase this wallet.

   - **Nonce** (number used only once):

     - in blockchain node is add by minor node(type of full node)
     - header : this header contain previous node, markable root, timestamp and nonce.
     - nonce is give number and check difficulty level is less or more.

   - **hash** :

     - header contains hash of previous node.

# Smart Contracts

- Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between the buyer and the seller being directly written into lines of code.
- These contracts are stored on a blockchain network and automatically execute and enforce the terms of the agreement when predetermined conditions are met.
- They operate without the need for intermediaries, such as lawyers or banks, and are tamper-proof and transparent.
- smart contracts is nothing but if-else things, ex. if my fund is not collected so rest of collected fund is return to people.
- if you give me 5 coin so i give you 20 candy.
- they are allow to switching tokens, using smart contracts we switching tokens.

## features of Smart Contract

- Scalability
- Proof of History (PoH)
- Tower BFT Consensus
- Parallel Processing
- Low Fees and Fast Confirmations
- Solana Token (SOL)

# DApps

- DApps - decentralized application.

## what makes DApps unique

- Decentralization
- Transparency
- Smart Contracts

### example of DApps :

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**:
  - refers to a rapidly evolving ecosystem of financial applications built on top of public blockchains
- **Non - fungible Tokens (NFTs)**:

  - Non-Fungible Tokens, have emerged as a unique way to represent ownership of digital assets

- **Cryptokitties** :

- **zed run** : 

    - gambling application

- **Gambling** :

- this DApps is never goes offline coz this apps run by thousand of computer.
