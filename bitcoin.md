# bitcoin

#### what is bitcoin
- bitcoin is a protocol like http
- token and coin are differant

#### bitcoin's monitery policy
- in this policy there are two monitery : the halving and block frequency(time taken by one block building)
- first reward of mining is 50 BTC
- avarage time for finding new block is 10 minutes

#### how mining works
- nonce is a number for solve a methematical problem
- nonce is change hash value and reach as near as possible to hash with is given by blockchain
- nonce is solve by miner
- when we find hash funciton nonce value so this value is must be less then target value
- hexadecimal number : each charactor is 4 bit number and 64(hexadecimal charactor) * 4 = 256

#### bitcoin target history
- this target is given by algorithm

#### CPU & GPU & ASIC
- this all are for mining 
- less miner are use ASIC because this is very costly

#### mining pool 
- this is a group of miner where big system miner is not dominant the mining

#### nonce range

#### TimeStamp
- when miner not finding any hash value in given nonce range so we need to give timestamp for solving this problem

#### mempool
- store a panding transaction of blockchain
